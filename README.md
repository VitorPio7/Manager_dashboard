# Manager Dashboard API

> Robust backend for a management dashboard — faithful to the original repository.

---

## About the Project

Manager Dashboard API serves as the backend foundation for a management platform. Its main goal is to provide secure and well-structured endpoints to support a future front-end interface (planned with React + TypeScript). It’s designed to handle large amounts of product and user data with scalability and security in mind.

## ✨ Key Features

* Secure authentication using JWT (register and login).
* Full CRUD for users (create, read, update, delete).
* Scalable architecture ready to manage other resources (e.g., products, clients, projects).
* Clear route and controller structure to simplify front-end integration.
* Focus on scalability and best practices.

## 🛠️ Technologies

* Node.js
* Express.js
* (Planned/expected) MongoDB with Mongoose
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* (Planned) TypeScript for future improvements
