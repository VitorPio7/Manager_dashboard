# Manager Dashboard API

> Robust backend for a management dashboard — faithful to the original repository.

---

## About the Project

Manager Dashboard API serves as the backend foundation for a management platform. Its main goal is to provide secure and well-structured endpoints to support a future front-end interface (planned with React + TypeScript). It’s designed to handle large amounts of product and user data with scalability and security in mind.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Secure authentication using JWT (register and login).
* Full CRUD for users (create, read, update, delete).
* Scalable architecture ready to manage other resources (e.g., products, clients, projects).
* Clear route and controller structure to simplify front-end integration.
* Focus on scalability and best practices.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

* Node.js
* Express.js
* (Planned/expected) MongoDB with Mongoose
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* (Planned) TypeScript for future improvements

## 📂 Project Structure (overview)

```

├─ backend/
│  ├─ controllers/       # business logic for endpoints
│  ├─ models/            # Mongoose models (users, products, etc.)
│  ├─ routes/            # route definitions
│  ├─ middleware/        # authentication, validation, and error handling
│  ├─ config/            # configuration files (db, env)
│  ├─ app.js / index.js  # main server entry point
│  └─ package.json
├─ .gitignore
└─ README.md
```

> Note: The structure shown reflects the intended setup. Adjust paths and filenames according to your actual implementation in `backend/`.

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or yarn
* MongoDB (local or Atlas) — if using another database, update the data layer accordingly.

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables (example)

Create a `.env` file in the backend root directory with the following values:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/manager_dashboard?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
```

Modify variable names and values as needed.

## 🚀 Installation & Run Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VitorPio7/Manager_dashboard.git
cd Manager_dashboard/backend
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. **Set up your `.env` file** (see the previous section)

4. **Run in development mode:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
node index.js
# or
npm start
```

> `npm run dev` assumes `nodemon` is configured in your `package.json`. Adjust if needed.

## 📡 API Endpoints (general overview)

> The following is a general description of expected routes based on the repository’s purpose. Check the actual `routes/` folder for implementation details.

### Authentication

* `POST /auth/register` — create an account
* `POST /auth/login` — authenticate and receive a JWT

### Users

* `GET /users` — list all users (protected)
* `GET /users/:id` — get user by ID (protected)
* `POST /users` — create a new user (admin/protected)
* `PUT /users/:id` — update user info (protected)
* `DELETE /users/:id` — delete user (protected)

### Additional Resources (e.g., Products)

* `GET /products`
* `POST /products`
* `GET /products/:id`
* `PUT /products/:id`
* `DELETE /products/:id`

> All protected routes require a header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Validate input using `express-validator` or similar.
* Implement centralized error handling middleware.
* Use `helmet`, `cors`, and a rate limiter in production.
* Keep a clean separation of concerns (controllers, services, repositories).
* Write unit tests for critical features.
